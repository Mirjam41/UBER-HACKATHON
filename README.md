# UberCare
UberCare is an application that aims to provide inclusive modes and services of transport for the citizens of Uberland. We recognize that the existing transportation systems do not cater to all income and social segments in our society and have thus taken the initiative to provide an appropriate solution to this issue. With UberCare we’re promoting inclusivity, goodwill, and generosity by empowering those that are disabled, elderly or are struggling financially.  

## Features
### Uber Assistance
Those that have a mental or physical disability will be allocated volunteers that will accompany them throughout their entire journey. These will be specialists that will ensure that the customer reaches their destination safely and that they will guide them in case they get lost. Similarly, for elders, the helpers will guide them to the correct terminal and assist them with carrying their belongings.

### Low income individuals
users can pay for two or more rides while only going on one. This allows those of low income to order a free ride that has been funded already through these charity donations. If unavailable, there would be subsidized costs sourcing from the company’s earnings or the user’s points, this will help alleviate their financial burdens.

### Priority
Due to the scarcity of resources, it is very possible that the business may face a shortage of supply. At all times, users are ordered in a priority list that will determine the urgency of their ride based on the information they input.

### Point System
The purpose of the point system is to promote the less admired transportation methods (usually public transport) and facilitate the inhibition of congestion during peak hours.
